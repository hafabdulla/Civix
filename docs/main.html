            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Golden Ratio, often denoted by the Greek letter φ (phi), is a mathematical constant that has fascinated mathematicians, artists, and architects for centuries. Approximately equal to 1.618, this unique ratio appears in nature, art, and design, celebrated for its aesthetic harmony and balance. One of the most intriguing connections to the Golden Ratio is found in the Fibonacci sequence—a series of numbers where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...). As the Fibonacci numbers grow larger, the ratio between successive terms approaches the Golden Ratio, illustrating a beautiful mathematical link between these two timeless concepts.</p>
